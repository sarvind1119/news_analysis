Yonhap/Reuters CNN — Winning a gold medal is a big deal. As a result, athletes want to be able to celebrate and soak in their moment at the top of their sport . However, for South Korean skater Jung Cheol-won, the decision to celebrate a fraction of a second too early cost him and his teammates a spot atop the podium – and an exemption from mandatory military service. Jung was part of the three-man South Korean team taking part in the men’s 3,000m speed skating relay final at the Huangzhou Asian Games in China on Monday. The 27-year-old, who was skating the final leg of the race, approached the finish line just ahead of Taiwan’s Huang Yu-Lin. Thinking that he had the gold medal sealed, Jung chose to raise his hands aloft and not reach for the finish line. Unbeknownst to him, Huang stretched a long, left leg forward and was just able to pip Jung to first place. As a result, Taiwan finished with a time of 4:05.692 for the gold medal, with South Korea crossing the line in second place with a time of 4:05.702, meaning that Taiwan won the gold by an agonizing 0.01 seconds. India finished in third with a time of 4:10.128. “I thought it was such a shame that I was just a little bit short, and then the results came up on the screen showing that we had won by one hundredth of a second, and it was just a miracle,” Huang said after the race, according to Reuters. After the race, Jung apologized for how he finished his final lap. “I made a rather big mistake,” Jung said, per Reuters . “I didn’t come at full speed to the finish line. I let my guard down too early. I am very sorry.” Jung prematurely celebrates after crossing the finish line in the men's final of the speed skating 3,000m relay race. Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty Images The result was made even worse for Jung and one of his teammates, Choi In-ho, as by not winning the gold medal, it meant that the pair missed out on an exemption from having to take part in South Korea’s military service. Military service is compulsory for men in South Korea, with almost all able-bodied persons required to serve in the army for 18 months by the age of 28. The mandatory duty can be waived for some athletes, in particular, those who win an Olympic medal or a gold medal in the Asian Games. However, South Korean law allows men who are deemed to excel in sports, popular culture, art or higher education to defer their service until the age of 30. The stipulation means that Choi has another opportunity to earn an exemption at the 2026 Asian Games in Aichi and Nagoya, Japan.","Jung Cheol-won was part of the South Korean team taking part in the men’s 3,000m speed skating relay final at the Huangzhou Asian Games in China on Monday.

The race numbers for Lin Yuwei and Wu Yanni form '64' - a common allusion to the incident which happened on 4 June. Discussions of the incident remain taboo in China, with authorities routinely scrubbing any mention of the topic from the internet. In 1989, troops shot dead hundreds of pro-democracy protesters in Beijing. It remains unclear how many people actually died that day, but human rights groups' estimates range from several hundred to several thousand killed. Tiananmen Square: What happened in the protests of 1989? China's Lipstick King sparks Tiananmen questions The athletes had embraced each other after a 100m hurdles race at the Asian Games in which Ms Lin won gold. She was wearing her lane number 6 next to Ms Wu's lane number 4 in the photo. Users had posted on Weibo, one of China's biggest social media platforms, congratulating Ms Lin.  However, posts which included the photo were replaced with grey squares. However, the photo does not appear to have been completely scrubbed off the internet, with some Chinese news articles still showing a photo of the two athletes. China has won nearly 300 medals so far in the Asian Games, which are currently taking place in the Chinese city of Hangzhou. It is due to go on until 8 October. Image caption, Photos of the athletes hugging have been scrubbed from Weibo Discussion of the events that took place in Tiananmen Square is highly sensitive in China - with generations of younger Chinese growing up with little to no knowledge about the Tiananmen Square massacre. Posts relating to the massacres are regularly removed from the internet, tightly controlled by the government. Last year, a popular Chinese influencer's livestream, which took place on the eve of the 33rd anniversary of the massacre, ended abruptly  after he showed his audience a vanilla log cake which resembled a tank - a reference to a iconic image of one so-called Tank Man, which shows a civilian with shopping bags standing in front of a queue of tanks, attempting to block them.

Photo: Reuters Tech Big Tech Asian Games 2023: China bags over half the gold medals at esports events even as Beijing maintains its harsh policies over video gaming Esports turned out to be one of the most popular Asian Games events – and the most widely discussed topic on Chinese social media over the past few weeks Despite official restrictions, Hangzhou is betting on video game competitions to generate excitement and boost its economy amid slower economic growth Video gaming + FOLLOW Ann Cao in Hangzhou + FOLLOW Published: 7:03pm, 3 Oct, 2023 Why you can trust SCMP China won four esports gold medals out of seven matches at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, providing a morale boost for the country’s video gaming fans who yearn for recognition of their hobby amid Beijing’s hostility towards the industry. Tens of thousands of young Chinese, some joined by their parents, flocked to Hangzhou, capital of eastern Zhejiang province, to cheer teams competing in video games, which have been labelled “spiritual opium” by Chinese state media. Youth addiction to gaming is regarded as a “social problem” in China, leading to restrictions on players under the age of 18, who can only log into gaming accounts for a maximum of three hours per week. But at the purpose-built Hangzhou Esports Centre over the weekend, the mood was different. “The matches are very exciting,” said Jin Kaijie, who travelled from the city of Zhuji in Zhejiang to watch a League of Legends competition between China and Vietnam. The title, created by US-based studio Riot Games but operated locally by Chinese gaming giant Tencent Holdings, has a huge fan base in the country. The 24-year-old Jin said he has been a fan since Tencent launched a professional tournament for the game in China in 2013. Why China esports gold at Asian Games is unlikely to see Beijing relax limits China’s national teams won gold medals for the Asian Games versions of Arena of Valor and Peacekeeper Elite , Dream Three Kingdoms 2 and Dota 2 , as well as a bronze for League of Legends . Esports turned out to be one of the most popular Asian Games events – and the most widely discussed topic on Chinese social media over the past few weeks. Esports was the only competition in Hangzhou to deploy a lottery system for tickets due to the huge demand, as Chinese fans rushed to sign up for seats to view the events. After China won the gold medal for Dota 2 – a four-hour battle with Mongolia on Monday night – it quickly overtook China’s winning of the table tennis gold medal to become the top trending topic on social media platform Weibo. “I signed up for every single competition during the holiday, and was lucky enough to secure a place for the Peacekeeper Elite match,” said Pu Guanlin, a 17-year-old student from the southwestern city of Kunming, who travelled to Hangzhou with his parents for the National Day holiday. It was also the first time that many Chinese people got to know esports, including the older generations. Pu Guanlin, a 17-year-old student from Kunming, travelled to Hangzhou with his parents to watch the Asian Games. Photo: Ann Cao On Saturday morning, Zhao Zhengjie, a Hangzhou native, took his 11-year-old son to watch the competition for Peacekeeper Elite , a localised version of PUBG Mobile , as the 40-year-old said it was “a very rare opportunity” for a Hangzhou native to support the debut of esports as an Asian Games medal event. Despite official restrictions on the industry, Hangzhou is betting on video game competitions to generate excitement and boost its economy amid slower economic growth. Last November, the Hangzhou government pledged 100 million yuan (US$14 million) in annual funding for video gaming and esports. Since last year, the Hangzhou Esports Centre has hosted professional competitions sponsored by Tencent and rival games giant NetEase, a trend that looks set to continue even after the Asian Games has ended. For the management of the purpose-built venue, the popularity of esports was beyond their expectation. Almost all the esports-related merchandise was sold out in the first few days, according to a staff member who worked in the venue’s merchandise shop. However, the nine days of competitions are not just for cheers and applause. Esports, just like any other traditional sport, have now become a point of national pride in China. Zhao Zhengjie, a Hangzhou native, took his 11-year-old son to watch the Peace Elite competition on September 30. Photo: Ann Cao When the Chinese League of Legends team, which was expected to take the gold medal again since winning a demonstration match at the 18th Asian Games in Jakarta, failed to advance to the finals after losing 0-2 to South Korea, patriotic Chinese fans took to social media to vent their disappointment. “It was such a pity that we didn’t hear our national anthem, but that of South Korea, on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival,” said a user with the handle of “Douyou” on Chinese online forum Douban. Sunyee Liu, a 22-year-old from the southern city of Shenzhen, said the loss would reduce her passion for professional video game competitions in the future. For some young fans, China’s restrictions on video games have become too harsh. Spectators leave the Hangzhou Esports Centre after the end of a match on September 29. Photo: Ann Cao Zhao said he allowed his son to play video games – especially Honour of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite – after school. “Times are changing and he is facing a more exciting world than when I was young,” he said, adding that time spent video gaming by kids should not “exceed a certain extent”. However Pu, the high school student, said he hoped the rules could be relaxed in future. “I will be studying every Friday night and get ready for school again on Sunday nights. That means I can only play for one hour each week [on Saturdays]. It would be better if they can relax the time frame so at least I can play for three hours a week,” said Pu. 3","China won four esports gold medals out of seven matches at the Asian Games in Hangzhou.

China booked a quota in both the men’s and women’s competitions, Otgonbold Baatarkhuyag ’s surprise finals berth secured a recurve men’s spot for Mongolia and, by lining up an all-Korean recurve women’s gold medal match, Lim Sihyeon and Tokyo’s triple gold medallist An San finally added a first ticket for Paris. The Korean women’s team are undefeated at the Games having won nine straight titles since 1988. The squad’s historic failure to secure even a single quota spot at the primary qualifier, the 2023 Hyundai World Archery Championships , was perhaps the biggest shock of the event. Although no team place was available to win this week in Hangzhou – one will be given to the winner at the Asian Championships in November – the Korean women now at least have one space for Paris 2024 . “I felt regret,” said An San when asked about the disappointing outcome earlier this summer in Berlin. But after today’s competition, spirits in the Korean camp are much higher. “I’m in a very good mood. I’m starting to feel the nervousness now,” she continued. “But the competition isn’t over yet. I will give my all until the very end.” The recurve men’s title at the Asian Games will go to a non-Korean archer for the first time since 2002 – and it might be China’s Qi Xiangshuo who wins it. Ranked 23rd in the world arriving at these Asian Games, the 26-year-old secured the first major final of his relatively young career by upsetting top seed Lee Woo Seok in a semifinal tiebreak. Both shot 10s – but the home nation archer’s arrow was measured closer to the middle. Making the gold medal match also secured China an Olympic place. Xiangshuo’s focus was singular. “What we are striving for is qualification for all three of us. An individual spot doesn’t mean much,” he said. However, an Asian Games gold medal would mean a lot – and he’ll get it if he can beat one last opponent, an archer who is ranked just 293rd in the world, 270 places lower than Qi. Shock finalist Otgonbold Baatarkhuyag has already secured Mongolia’s first podium in archery’s 45-year history at the multisport event. “I’m very, very happy,” he said after a four-set semifinal win over Kazakhstan’s Ilfat Abdullin . “We’re going to the Olympics.” In another historic result, India secured its first-ever individual champion at the Asian Games after compound eliminations as the men’s final will see World Archery Champion Pravin Deotale and Abhishek Verma , the runner-up at the 2014 edition of this multisport event, contest the title. Top-seeded compound woman Jyothi Surekha Vennam can add a second gold by beating So Chaewon of Korea. Competition at the Asian Games continues with mixed team finals on Wednesday when two more quota places for the next Olympic Games will be awarded.

Japan silenced the partisan crowd in Hangzhou to lead 4-1 at the break and put one foot in the final, as the China players trudged off the pitch into the dressing rooms. But a China team made up of players from the recent World Cup refused to go quietly and they pulled it back to 4-3 with half an hour left, setting up a grandstand finale. But Japan kept their concentration and nerve to hold out for victory and teed up a showdown with North Korea on Friday for gold. ""At the start of the second half we knew they would attack us and we let them do that to an extent,"" said Japan coach Michihisa Kano, whose side has hit an incredible 35 goals in five matches at the Games. He said his substitutes had helped make the game safe. ""It was difficult at times, but the players who came on worked hard, did their job and helped us get the win. I want to thank my players,"" he added. North Korea thrashed Uzbekistan 8-0 in the other semifinal to set up a repeat of the 2014 final, with striker Kim Kyong Yong scoring four goals. On the fifth day in track and field, Bahrain's Kemi Adekoya -- who was stripped of the 2018 title for doping -- won 400 meters hurdles gold. The 30-year-old won at the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon after switching allegiance from Nigeria, and again came first at Jakarta four years later. But she was stripped of her 2018 hurdles and mixed 4x400m relay golds after testing positive for the prohibited steroid stanozolol. She was banned for four years. A former world indoor champion, she claimed at the time her food was spiked. ""I just wanted to fight and get the gold medal, and fight for a new record,"" she said on Tuesday after clocking a Games-record 54.45sec for gold. Adekoya, who only recently returned to action, won the 400m title on Saturday. China's Wu Yu enjoyed an afternoon stroll to the first boxing gold of the Games as she easily defeated Thailand's Chuthamat Raksat in the final of the women's flyweight (50 kg) on unanimous points. Tajikistan's Davlat Boltaev won the first men's gold with a controversial 3-2 split decision over China's Han Xuezhen in the heavyweight (92kg) division. Wu, who barely broke sweat, and whose face was completely unmarked, told AFP: ""It was as comfortable as it looked."" But the Chinese boxer, who won the world championship in the non-Olympic 52kg weight class in Delhi earlier this year, said she thinks she can do even better. Gold at the Paris Olympics next year is already on her mind. ""My main rival is myself. I will not be afraid of even the strongest rivals if I keep breaking through my limits and making myself stronger,"" she said. ""I think it's better to stay down to earth. I am only at the second stage now that I've got a ticket to the Paris Olympics."" In road cycling, Kazakhstan's Alexey Lutsenko, a 2020 stage winner on the Tour de France, won gold in the men's individual time trial by two minutes from China's Xue Ming. Olga Zabelinskaya of Uzbekistan took the women's crown. It was a fourth Asian Games gold for Lutsenko, stretching back to Incheon in 2014, but he does not intend to stop there with the road race still to come. Arch-rivals India and Pakistan remain on course for a blockbuster men's cricket final.

South Korean skater Jung Cheol-won had an Asian Games gold medal in his grasp but then decided to celebrate. Jung, a member of the three-man South Korean skating team, took part in the men’s 3,000-meter speed skating relay in the Asian Games on Monday. The 27-year-old was the skater in the final leg of the relay race and put on a great performance until he met the finish line. Jung, thinking he had won the gold medal already, raised his hands and slowed down as he approached the finish line and the premature celebration allowed Taiwan’s Huang Yu-Lin to sneak past him to win the race. Taiwan finished with a time of 4:05.692 to win the gold medal, with South Korea crossing the line in second place with a time of 4:05.702. Jung and the South Korean team lost the gold medal by 0.01 seconds. South Korea’s Jung Cheol-won (C) reacts after the men’s final of the speed skating 3000m relay race during the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou. (Photo by WANG ZHAO/AFP via Getty Images) Going from thinking that you have just helped yourself and teammate Choi In-ho avoid having to serve in the army to then realize you just made the biggest mistake of your entire life – and to find out the difference was 0.01 seconds – has to be a feeling not many humans have ever felt. “I made a rather big mistake,” Jung said, per Reuters . “I didn’t come at full speed to the finish line. I let my guard down too early. I am very sorry.” South Korean law allows men who are deemed to excel in sports to defer their military service until the age of 30. With Jung being 27 and the next Asian Games not taking place until 2026, he missed out on his last opportunity to gain military exemption. Thankfully for Choi, he’s still young enough to get another shot at a gold medal to earn exempt status in 2026. asian games south korea Written by Mark Harris Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Then the Indonesian burst into life when he came off the platform to celebrate wildly with his father Erwin Abdullah, who is also his coach after his victory in the 73 kilograms category. ""I always empty my mind every time I lift,"" said Erwin, whose past 10 competitions have yielded an Olympic bronze medal, two world titles, Asian Games gold and world records at two different weights. ""The key to winning is to stay calm, not waste any energy."" The celebration was heartfelt. His father won silver at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, Korea and his mother was also a champion weightlifter. ""I wanted to celebrate at the Asian Games like he did in Korea in 2002 and I want to do it with him again,"" said Abdullah. ""I owe my parents so much. My father starting teaching me (about technique) when I was four."" Abdullah’s final lift of 201 kilograms bettered his own clean and jerk world record at 73kg, four weeks after he broke the 81kg clean and jerk record at the World Championships at Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. ""My preparation was quite hard, as you can imagine,"" he said. Oh Kumthaek earned a bronze medal on what was his international debut ©Getty Images Erwin weighed in light in Saudi Arabia but still had to lose 4kg while training for Hangzhou. ""I’m looking forward to eating again,"" he said. ""I will go to the dining hall and celebrate."" Silver medallist Weeraphon Wichuma from Thailand was more interested in rest than food. He won at 73kg in Saudi Arabia, took two weeks to recover and had only two weeks to prepare. ""That was tough, I’ll take a break now until the Asian Championships in February,"" said the 19-year-old. The bronze medallist had no such worries. Oh Kumthaek from North Korea began weightlifting aged 12, but he did not make his international debut until today, 14 years later. Erwin made a six-from-six 158-201-359, a Games record total, and Wichuma’s 156-195-351 was a career best. Oh made 151-193-344 but was ""regretful that I did not win gold."" China's Wei Yinting bombed out in the clean and jerk after making a Games record snatch of 161kg, while the second North Korean in the field, Pak Jongju, missed three attempts and finished fourth on 339kg.

In an unusual turn of events in the men’s 110m hurdles final at the 2023 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China, Japanese hurdler Shunya Takayama and Kuwait’s Yaqoub Alyouha found themselves in a dead heat, both finishing in 13.41 (.409) seconds, sharing the gold medal.

After several replays, they eventually confirmed that both Takayama and Alyouha had clocked identical times. A dead heat in track and field is when two or more athletes cross the finish line at the same time—and no individual winner can be named. WATCH: British sprinter wins national title in monsoon Takayama won bronze in the 110m hurdles at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta and now upgraded that medal to gold in 2023. “Getting a gold medal makes me very happy,” said Takayama to reporters post-race. “To get two gold medals with another athlete makes me twice as happy.” Alyouha, too, said it was a pleasure to share the victory, acknowledging the rarity of such an outcome in their line of work. “It’s a great pleasure for me to win the gold,” said Alyouha. “My nerves ran cold waiting for confirmation that I won.” In the history of the Olympics and World Championships, there has not been a shared track medal since the men’s decathlon in 1912. Alyouha and Takayama are the first sprinters to share a gold at the Asian Games.

But it was a third-quarter conflict that fired the home fans up the most in Hangzhou, after flashpoints across several different sports between the two nations at the 19th Asiad. The squabble was sparked when Zhao Jiwei’s arm was clamped by South Korea’s Jeon Sung-hyun, with the pair tussling over the ball. Both sets of players then rushed in and a physical altercation almost broke out, but the officials broke things up, and the referee awarded a physical foul on each side. “Every time I watch them play, I get p***** off by the Koreans. Can’t you have some sportsmanship?” one user wrote on Chinese social media platform Weibo, where the incident was trending. Another fan blasted South Korea for being “weak” and showing “shameless moves” during the on-court argument, while one said “South Korea is really dirty no matter what kind of sport it is”. South Korean athletes have come under the spotlight in Hangzhou for a perceived lack of sportsmanship. Judoka Lee Hye-kyeong was disqualified for slapping her opponent in the face, while tennis star Kwon Soon-woo smashed his racket after a loss and then refused to shake hands with his Thai rival. One post on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform, praised China’s Wang Zhelin and Xiao Cui for “rushing in the most fiercely” and “going up to fight” while other players were trying to break things up. China’s player celebrate on the bench during the match. Photo: Xinhua Du Runwang was the star of the show for China, scoring a game-high 16 points and six rebounds, and hitting four of seven three-pointers. His performance earned high praise from coach Aleksandar Dordevic. “I hope to bring him to the post-match press conference next time. He has performed well in these two games and had a good touch on offence, which has brought great influence to the team. Very helpful,” the Serbian said. Du insisted he would take his coach up on his wish – but only if they win gold on home soil at the Games. “I will continue to work hard. What I hope most is to win the championship and then attend the post-game press conference,” he said. Du Runwang goes for a layup against South Korea. Photo: Xinhua This time it was Zhu Junlong who came to speak to the media, with the coach also singling out his “very good job on defence”. “This is also the reason why I chose him to attend this press conference,” Dordevic said. “I also ask my players who they want to attend the press conference, and they will recommend players with outstanding performances. One of the reasons for the good atmosphere is that I fully respect their ideas.” Aleksandar Djordjevic instructs his players on the sidelines. Photo: Xinhua China’s head coach also admitted their semi-final opponents will be a “tough” match, especially given the Philippines beat them 96-75 in Manila at the Basketball World Cup last month. The Gilas Pilipinas edged past Iran 84-83 in their quarter-final on Tuesday. “Last time we played against each other, they played a wonderful performance in the second half and deserved the victory in that game,” Dordevic said. “This is a good opportunity for revenge. Although Jordan Clarkson is missing this time, the Philippines is a very experienced team. We need to play our own basketball, defend well, and stay focused.” 6",China beat South Korea 84-70 to set up semi-final against Philippines. Third-quarter conflict fires home fans up the most in Hangzhou. Squabble sparked when Zhao Jiwei’s arm was clamped by Jeon Sung-hyun.

                         / @junavINQ Philippine Daily Inquirer / 04:30 AM October 03, 2023 Hidilyn Diaz-Naranjo has something to smile about despite dropping out of the medal race in weightlifting. —ASIAN GAMES POOL There should be adequate worry over the country’s attempt to at least replicate what has been the most successful Olympic trip by Team Philippines ever in Tokyo two years ago. Four medals, one of them the breakthrough gold. At the ongoing Asian Games here in Hangzhou, China, two of those medalists crashed out of the podium race, one of them the breakthrough gold winner. ADVERTISEMENT But Hidilyn Diaz-Naranjo brushed off her latest slipup in her bid to repeat her golden triumph next year in the Paris Olympics by putting into context exactly where her fourth-place finish in the Asian Games weightlifting event falls in her grand scheme with a little joke during a postgame interview. FEATURED STORIES SPORTS Brownlee says Gilas up to task of taking down China in Asian Games semis SPORTS Gilas Pilipinas escapes Iran to reach Asian Games semifinals SPORTS Syrian crowd-pleaser stands in Eumir Marcial’s Paris path “I’m so happy with today’s training, I mean today’s result,’’ said Diaz-Naranjo laughing. And by her own reckoning, that “training” session showed her what she wanted to see: Diaz-Naranjo is gradually building up the strength necessary to become a worthy contender in the 2024 Summer Games. ADVERTISEMENT “Just a few more kilos and I’ll be moving closer to getting into the top 5 or 6 (in the world),’’ said Diaz-Naranjo after winding up fourth in women’s weightlifting on Monday. It would have been a disappointing finish considering Diaz-Naranjo was heavily counted on to bump up Team Philippines’ gold count. The delegation also lost Olympic silver medalist Nesthy Petecio after she lost her bout in women’s boxing. Forced to switch to a heavier class for her bid in the Olympics, where her normal fighting weight was scrubbed, Diaz-Naranjo finished with a combined lift of 223 kilograms built on her 97 in the snatch and 126 in the clean and jerk. North Korea’s Kim Ilgyong grabbed the gold medal, shattering all the division’s records along the way. The 20-year-old lifter pushed the bar to 111 kg in the snatch and carried 133 in the clean and jerk for a total of 246, setting a new world record and continental standard in both elite and junior divisions. But the Asian Games was never really an event circled in Diaz-Naranjo’s calendar. “This [Asian Games] isn’t a qualifier [to the Olympics]. I just really wanted to compete here,’’ said Diaz-Narnjo. Still pleased But something about her performance had her pleased. “So far, so good. You saw I’d attempted 100 (kgs) [in the snatch] and 131 [in the clean and jerk]. It’s my first time trying them and it made me realize how stronger I’ve become,’’ said Diaz-Naranjo, who used the event to test how she would fare against the division’s top bets. “All of them are strong, but I’m still happy. At the end of the day, it’s Paris 2024 that matters,’’ she said.China’s Luo Shifang was unseated as Asian champion and settled for the silver following a 240 effort on the strength of a 107 in the snatch and 126 in the clean and jerk.Hsing Chun Kuo of Chinese Taipei completed the podium with a 227 lift despite being hobbled by an injured left knee. “I think China will be the toughest competitor (in Paris) while Chinese Taipei could be second. I also have to put up against Ukraine, Columbia and Canada,’’ said Diaz-Naranjo, who won the Olympic gold in the women’s 55 kg. Kim, the North Korean lifting wonder, won’t be seeing action in Paris. According to Samahang Weightlifting ng Pilipinas president Monico Puentevella, North Korean lifters could be barred from participating in the Olympics since they refuse to undergo doping tests. The 32-year-old Filipino weightlifting heroine is eyeing for a fifth consecutive appearance in the Olympics. Your subscription could not be saved. Please try again.

                         / @junavINQ Philippine Daily Inquirer / 04:25 AM October 04, 2023 Elreen Ann Ando becomes Team Philippines’ saving grace in the weightlifting competition of the 19th Asian Games and leaves disappointments in the last big meet behind. –AP HANGZHOU, CHINA—Sidetracked by a demoralizing meltdown in the continental championships a few months back, Elreen Ann Ando has just rediscovered her confidence—and the road back to the Paris Olympics. The Tokyo Olympian from Cebu regained her bearings with a bronze medal effort in the 19th A sian Games , a timely confidence boost entering the final stretch of qualification for the quadrennial world showcase in the glitzy fashion capital. ADVERTISEMENT “This will help me a lot in my qualifying bid to Paris. I somehow regained my confidence,’’ said Ando in Filipino after claiming the eighth bronze medal for Team Philippines in the women’s 64-kilogram category FEATURED STORIES SPORTS Gilas Pilipinas escapes Iran to reach Asian Games semifinals SPORTS Syrian crowd-pleaser stands in Eumir Marcial’s Paris path SPORTS Asian Games: South Korean skater loses gold after early celebration .Resuming her Olympic shot would mean going through a gauntlet of Paris aspirants in the 59 kg division, including her toughest rival yet—and sentimental favorite—in Tokyo Olympics gold medalist Hidilyn Diaz-Naranjo. Both Ando’s and the regular weight class of Diaz-Naranjo were scrubbed off the 2024 Olympic program, forcing them to meet at the crossroads of the same category. ADVERTISEMENT Diaz-Naranjo came from the 55-kg class where she rewarded the country its first Olympic gold in Japan, while the 24-year-old Ando slid from her old 64-kg division. “I want to be in Paris. I’ll train harder, hoping to earn that spot,’’ said Ando. That is the word, as only one between Diaz-Naranjo and Ando can get that call-up from the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF), the world body of the sport that facilitates the qualification phase and the tournament proper in the Olympics. They must complete five required IWF-sanctioned qualification meets and stay within the top 10 before the window closes a month leading to the Summer Games. Frustration in Korea While Diaz-Naranjo has already put three tournaments in the bag, Ando secured one in the 2023 World Weightlifting Championships in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, last month where she finished eighth behind Diaz-Naranjo, who was seventh. Ando’s frustration took shape when she failed to lift in the clean and jerk during the Asian championships in Jinji, South Korea, in May. “I was really depressed back then, so I restarted again in Saudi (world championships),’’ said the 59-kg gold medalist of this year’s Southeast Asian Games in Cambodia. Although the Asian Games is no Olympic qualifier, her bronze here has its fringe benefits, one that Ando vows to spend as a gift for the entire family on her birthday next month. She will then swing back to the gym right away for World Cup events in Qatar in December and another one in Thailand in February while eyeing another continental qualifier later on. “I have to build strength going into these tournaments. I think I’m capable of doing it,’’ said Ando. Your subscription could not be saved. Please try again. Your subscription has been successful.

Another concern is the tenacious lineup in the Olympics with favorites Luo Shifang of China, Chinese Taipei’s Hsing-Chun Kuo and North Korea’s Kim Ilgyong bannering their category. She’ll have to get that Olympics spot first and deal with all of them there. READ NEXT More than the bronze, Elreen Ando wins confidence back in Pari...

For context, always refer to the full article. FOCUSED. Hidilyn Diaz flashes a smile after a successful first lift in the Asian Games. PSC-POC MEDIA POOL INFO Hidilyn Diaz says 'at the end of the day, Paris 2024 is still the most important,' as she trains her sights on a winning Olympic return MANILA, Philippines – Hidilyn Diaz-Naranjo was far from a sore loser after missing the 19th Asian Games podium by just one rank in the women’s 59kg category in Hangzhou, China, on Monday, October 2. The Philippines’ first and only Olympic gold medalist was all smiles despite settling for fourth place with a 223kg total coming off a 97kg snatch and 126kg clean and jerk. After all, the veteran Diaz knew she was sailing on uncharted waters for her career after her usual 55kg category was abolished ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics, and so bumps along the way were expected. “My opponents were all very strong, but I’m still happy [with the results], and yes, at the end of the day, Paris 2024 is still the most important,” she told reporters in Filipino after the competition. Strong indeed were the rest of the pack as 20-year-old North Korean sensation Kim Il-gyong smashed multiple benchmarks on her way to a world-record lift of 111kg in snatch and 135kg in clean and jerk, totaling an Asian Games record of 247kg. Diaz, meanwhile, fell at a 100kg snatch attempt and 131kg clean and jerk – both career-high marks at age 32 had she completed them. “So far, so good for my training here at 59kg. You saw how I tried for 100 and 131. It’s my first time to try those, and I didn’t realize I was already that strong,” she continued. Diaz will go through two more qualifying tournaments at her new weight class in an attempt to clinch her fifth straight Olympic appearance – likely her farewell run before settling down with her husband and coach Julius Naranjo. – Rappler.com Add a comment Error.

By : Sentinel Digital Desk | 2 Oct 2023 7:09 AM GMT HANGZHOU: Indian golfer Aditi Ashok bagged the silver medal after she was unable to hold onto her seven-shot lead and shot 5-over 77 in the final round of the Asian Games on Sunday. Meanwhile, the team also slipped from first to fourth and ended without a medal. Though it was a major disappointment for the Indian team, the individual silver medal for Aditi was the first-ever golf medal for India in Asian Games. It was a difficult day for scoring, as only six players shot under par and only two went into the 60s. One of them was the 21-year-old Arpichaya Yubol of Thailand, who like Aditi plays on the LPGA Tour. Yubol shot 68 in the final round and won the gold ahead of the Indian. The Indian women’s team also fell from the top spot to fourth and out of medals . As Yubol took gold, the silver went to Aditi and the bronze medal was claimed by Korea’s Hyunjo Yoo (65) who had the best round of the final day. In the men’s section, Anirban Lahiri (65-67-74-68) was T-12, SSP Chawrasia (67-72-68-75) dropped to T-28. Khalin Joshi (70-69-69-73) was T-27 and Shubhankar Sharma (68-69-76-73) was 32nd.

Coming into the final day with a commanding seven-stroke lead, Aditi saw the advantage evaporate as she stumbled upon four bogeys and a double bogey against a lone birdie to slip to the second position. ADVERTISEMENT In the forefront for the gold medal after three days, Aditi’s slump also saw the team slip from first to fourth and end without a medal. India’s other two players, Pranavi Urs (75) and Avani Prashanth (76), also had a rough day in the final round. Pranavi finished 13th and Avani was tied 18th. In the men’s section, Anirban Lahiri (65-67-74-68) was tied 12th while SSP Chawrasia (67-72-68-75) dropped to tied 28. Khalin Joshi (70-69-69-73) was tied 27th and Shubhankar Sharma (68-69-76-73) was 32nd. The Indian men ended seventh as Korea took gold while Thailand were second and Hong Kong third. It was a difficult day for scoring, as only six players shot under par and only two went into the 60s in the women’s competition. One of them was the 21-year-old Arpichaya Yubol of Thailand, who like Aditi plays on the LPGA Tour. Yubol shot 68 in the final round and won the gold ahead of the Indian. The bronze medal was claimed by Korea’s Hyunjo Yoo (65) who had the best round of the final day. Asked what her medal means for golf in India, Aditi said, “I do think it means something for golf, and hopefully, it gets more support and recognition back home in India. “Even the women’s team, I think we finished fourth, one position off from a medal, and that’s all positive.” She is hoping to translate her Hangzhou Games medal into Paris 2024 Olympics success. “These type of events are so different from regular golf tournaments. Just being able to have a good performance, living in the athletes’ village, playing on a course I’ve never played before … hopefully having this experience will translate to something good (in Paris), too,” she said. Having enjoyed a fine run in the first three days, Aditi faltered when it mattered the most. She started the final day with a clear lead of four shots but missed multiple putts to squander the advantage. On shooting 77 in her final round, she said, “It wasn’t a good day. I played bad. There’s no way around saying it. But overall if I look at my four-day score it’s pretty good. Seventeen under at the start of the week I would have taken that. “It’s just that when you shoot five over on the last day it doesn’t feel as good. “You’re never totally happy unless you win so I’m not too happy right now. I’m sure some day I’ll look back and think it was a good week but silver is not better than gold. “When I got fourth in Tokyo (Olympic Games) I wasn’t inconsistent like today. There, it was just four good rounds and somebody else was a few shots better. Today I kind of threw it away.”","Aditi Ashok cards a five-over 77 to sign off with a silver for India's first medal in women's golf at the Asian Games.

It’s redemption time for the Korean recurve women, long the cream of the international crop. They had a disastrous campaign at the world championships, failing to secure either an Olympic quota or any podium at all – no medal in the team or the individual events. Juxtapose that against the phenomenal rise of India this season… Three senior World Archery Champion crowns, including both the compound women’s and compound men’s individual titles courtesy Pravin Deotale and 18-year-old Aditi Swami . The country has never had an individual Asian Games winner before, only one team result in 2014. But this is India’s year. These Asian Games are the first in the multisport event’s 45-year archery history (the sport joined at the eighth edition in 1978) to award 10 gold medals, offering a full slate for both recurve and compound archers in individual, mixed team and team competitions. Key information What’s happening? The archery competitions at the 19th edition of the Asian Games on 1-7 October 2023 at Fuyang Yinhu Sports Centre in Hangzhou, China. What’s at stake? A full slate of 10 Asian Games Champion titles – five for recurve and five for compound – for the very first time, and six quota places for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games . Who’s competing? A total of 283 archers – 148 men and 135 women – from 33 countries, with 168 competing in the recurve and 115 in the compound events. What’s the story? Delayed one year due to border closures implemented by China during the pandemic, the Asian Games now fall squarely into the qualification period for the Paris 2024 Olympics . There are six quota spots available, to the recurve mixed team winner, as well as another two archers ranked highly in the individual events. But this mulitsport Games is very much seen as a continental versions of the Olympics themselves, and securing medals in Hangzhou is of the utmost important to teams from across Asia. Defending champions The winners at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta , where no individual titles were awarded to compound archers: Recurve men: Kim Woojin , Korea Recurve women: Zhang Xinyan , China Recurve men’s team: Korea Recurve women’s team: Korea Recurve mixed team: Japan Compound men’s team: Korea Compound women’s team: Korea Compound mixed team: Chinese Taipei The compound champions at the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon : Compound men: Esmaeil Ebadi , Iran Compound women: Choi Bomin , Korea Event schedule Sunday 1 October: Qualification Monday 2 October: Elimination Tuesday 3 October: Elimination Wednesday 4 October: Mixed team finals (Olympic quotas) Thursday 5 October: Compound team finals Friday 6 October: Recurve team finals Saturday 7 October: Finals (Olympic quotas) The line-up These are the top-ranked individual archers competing in Hangzhou (as of Thursday 28 September): Recurve men: Kim Woojin , Korea (world rank: 3) Recurve women: Lim Sihyeon , Korea (world rank: 3) Compound men: Abhishek Verma , India (world rank: 5) Compound women: J yothi Surekha Vennam , India (world rank: 4) These are the nations that will contest the team medals: Recurve men’s team (18): Bangladesh, China, Chinese Taipei, DPR Korea, Hong Kong China, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Kazakshan, Korea, Malaysia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Thailand, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. Recurve women’s team (17): Bangladesh, China, Chinese Taipei, DPR Korea, Hong Kong China, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Kazakshan, Korea, Malaysia, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Thailand, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. Recurve mixed team (23): Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Chinese Taipei, DPR Korea, Hong Kong China, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Kyrgyz Republic, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, UAE, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. Compound men’s team (15): Bangladesh, Bhutan, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong China, Indonesia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Korea, Malaysia, Mongolia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Compound women’s team (9): Bangladesh, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong China, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Korea, Mongolia, Thailand and Vietnam. Compound mixed team (17): Bangladesh, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong China, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Korea, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Qatar, Philipines, Singapore, Thailand, UAE and Vietnam. Storylines 1) Who goes through? There’s an unusual system in place at the Asian Games, which sees only the top two individuals in each team after qualification proceed through to the matchplay bracket. So even though a country may enter four archers in a single event, there is no chance that one nation can sweep the podium. 2) The significance. It is not easy to explain how important an Asian Games medal is across the continent – but they are particularly valuable in China, which holds national multisport games (kind of a country-wide Olympics) between provinces every four years. The medal table from that Chinese-only event also includes other major results secured during the period – but not all podiums are equal. An Olympic gold medal is worth three national games gold medals. An Asian Games gold medal? Two. 3) Path to Paris. Try and find one person (who has some interest in this sport) who thought the Korean women would be arriving in Hangzhou without a quota place for the 2024 Olympics. The best bit is – it’s not even guaranteed here, either. If the results in China end up identical to the results from the last Asian Games, five years ago in Jakarta, the Korean women would be leaving the competition without a quota place, too! 4) Aditi Swami. One way or another, India will find itself in the spotlight during the competition week. But wouldn’t it be wonderful if reigning under-18 world champion and senior World Archery Champion Swami added yet another major – and historic – victory in 2023. She’s already a near-lock for the breakout of the season award, why not make an even stronger case for the overall athlete of the year trophy? Competition format Archers at the Asian Games use either a recurve or compound bow and compete in the discipline of target archery . The recurve competitions take place over 70 metres and matches are decided using the set system . The compound competitions take place over 50 metres and matches are decided using cumulative scoring . A 72-arrow qualifying round is used to rank and seed athletes (and teams) for the matchplay phase. Archers then progress through head-to-head brackets, with the loser of each match eliminated and the winner advancing until a champion is crowned. During recurve set system matches, the goal is to accrue a target number of set points, which is six in the individual events and five in the mixed team and team events. Individual archers shoot sets of three arrows, mixed teams (pairs) sets of four arrows (two each), and teams (three athletes) sets of six arrows (two each). The archer or team with the highest arrow score in a set is awarded two set points, or one each for a draw. During compound cumulative scoring matches, the goal is to accrue the highest total arrow score over a set number of arrows. Individual archers shoot matches of 15 arrows, split into five ends of three; mixed teams shoot matches of 16 arrows, split into four ends of four (two each); and teams shoot matches of 24 arrows, split into four ends of six (two each). Equipment Archers competing at the Asian Games use a recurve or compound bow. The recurve bow is the modern evolution of traditional bows that have existed for 1000s of years. The limbs positioned at the top and bottom of the bow curve back away from the archer at each tip. This is what gives the ‘re-curve’ its name. Recurve has been the bowstyle used at the Olympic Games since archery’s reintroduction to the programme in 1972. It has featured at the Asian Games since 1978. The compound bow was invented in the 1960s as a more mechanically efficient piece of archery equipment. The design uses a levering system of pulleys and cables, making it faster and decidedly more accurate than other types of bow. Archers also use mechanical release aids and magnified sights. Compound was added to the World Archery Championships in 1995. It made its debut at the Asian Games in 2014. Competition at the 2022 Asian Games starts with qualifying on Sunday 1 October 2023.

Photo shows a women's kabaddi game between Nepal and Bangladesh at the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, east China's Zhejiang province, Oct. 2, 2023. (Photo by Han Xiaoming/People's Daily) Many of these events carry distinct Asian characteristics and thus build a stage to showcase the blending of sports and cultures. At the cricket venue of the Hangzhou Asian Games, cheers frequently arose from the stands. ""We bought tickets to several cricket matches. Cricket is hugely popular in India , just like table tennis in China . We've been watching cricket games and playing cricket since we were young,"" said Batra, an Indian spectator who came to Hangzhou for the Asian Games. Asia is vast in territory with a large population, diverse cultures and a long history. ""The selection of non-Olympic sports at the Asian Games fully considered the popularity of different sports across Asia ,"" said Zhu Qinan, director of the competition department of the Hangzhou Asian Games Organizing Committee. For instance, Wushu, sepak takraw, cricket, jujitsu and Kurash carry regional characteristics of East Asia , Southeast Asia , South Asia , Central Asia and West Asia respectively, he explained. These non-Olympic sports have enriched the competitions at the Asian Games and interpret the beauty of diversity of Asian sports, Zhu remarked. The Asian Games is like a window, which not only brings regionally popular sports into public view, but also facilitates cultural exchanges and mutual learning between different cultures. At the sepak takraw games of the Hangzhou Asian Games, whether scoring or making a turnover, players from both teams would gather in a circle on either side of the court, join hands with their teammates, and shout out loud together. ""This was my first time watching a sepak takraw match. I felt the teamwork essence of this sport,"" a spectator from Jinhua, Zhejiang province said. Story continues The roster of non-Olympic sports at each Asian Games has been quite dynamic, with certain sports ""rotating in and out"" over the years and new ones frequently making debut appearances. ""The Asian Games has always maintained an open and inclusive attitude, continuously embracing emerging sports that are popular and carry the features of the times,"" said Liu Mingyi, a professor with Wuhan Sports University. In his opinion, this kind of flexible arrangement helps the Asian Games maintain appeal and get closer to the general public.

Opting to bowl, Honk Kong made good use of the new ball when Ayush Shukla 's early wickets accounted for Mirza Baig and Rohail Nazir in the first three overs, followed by Haider Ali's dismissal in the next over. Captain Qasim Akram joined opener Omair Yousuf to consolidate to take them past 50 but he skied one to silly mid-off while targeting the leg-side boundary in the ninth over. Four balls later, Younus was bowled by Anas Khan for 21 and Pakistan were reeling at 54 for 5. Asif Ali stitched a useful stand of 19 with Khushdil Shah and of 36 with Arafat Minhas to stretch the score past 100. Even though Asif fell for 25 with 22 balls left in the innings, No. 9 Aamer Jamal blasted a 16-ball 41 to lift Pakistan to 160, which saw 49 runs in the last three overs, including 26 in the last. Pakistan also started well with the ball when Minhas struck twice in the powerplay, but No. 3 Babar Hayat kept them going at nearly six an over close to the halfway mark. Khushdil, however, sent him back for 29 and Hong Kong collapsed by losing six wickets for just nine runs to slip from 54 for 2 to 63 for 8. Khushdil took 3 for 13, and Manhas, Sufiyan Muqeem and Qasim grabbed two wickets apiece to bowl out Hong Kong in 18.5 overs.
